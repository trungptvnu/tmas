To test do the following

 lua miniducksimulator.lua

tested under:

 Lua 5.1.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2012 Lua.org, PUC-Rio

I only translated C++ Strategy pattern implementation into Lua.

And GoF patterns are not recommended in lua. One of the reason
stems from it's nature - a dynamic language not static like C++
There are talks related with this.

I hope my work be a starting point to study lua version of GoF
pattern which should be very much different than original GoF's

License I prefer is AFL 3.0
