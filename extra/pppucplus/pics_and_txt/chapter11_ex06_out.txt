triathlon de nyon 2012 olympic distance triathlon 

nyon is another race of the swiss triathlon circuit i had not 
done it before being far away and all but i got an 
offer to hitch a ride with a friend and was sold 

i should mention that this was at the end of a rather 
intense week so i did not expect too much from the race 

the water temperature was 22 1 c i e exactly above the 
treshold for non-wetsuit swims terrible news for somebody 
like me who cannot swim 

during a short warm-up swim lake geneva felt refreshing 
and nice the swim course layout was like this 

out and back a short run on the shore and another out 
and back it was around first half of the first loop where 
the water had become super calm around me a well-known 
phenomenon called the others have swum away no problem i 
thought 

but there was this stupid running bit between the two loops 
hundreds of people watching the women had their start about 
ten or fifteen minutes after us so i was very alone for my 
intermediate exit 

i have to say that having the audience's undivided attention 
has something to it maybe they were not up to speed as to 
who was where in the race just clapping for everybody maybe 
that was pity clapping if only the announcer would have 
kept his big mouth shut explaining my special position in 
the race in great detail even directing an it is not easy 
is it to me thanks a lot buddy 

anyway after that lowlight of my tri career i went back 
into the lake for the second loop soon the fastest women 
blasted past me and at least for the exit i was just one among 
many never mind that i was one man among many women at 
least the announcer could not single me out anymore 

happy face says it all 

arms in the background are female 

the rest is told quickly the bike was hilly and went okay 

the run was super hot and slower than usual which i chalked 
up to the week before the race 

a nice race overall just a little too far away and the lake 
a little too warm for my taste 

and one announcer everybody could do great without
